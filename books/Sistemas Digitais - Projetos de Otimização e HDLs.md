# Sistemas Digitais - Projetos de Otimização e HDLs

## Summary

This book shows us a deep study into the digital world, giving some tips about how it works at all.

## Introduction

When we talk about digital systems, we are talking about almost everything with technology that surrounds us, from medical tools to stuffs we find to be simple on our life, like our smartphone or even cameras.

## Signals

In the digital system world we have two common signals: **Digital** and **Analog**.

### Analog Signal

It was the first signal created and it is used even nowadays on some stuffs, per example: **Audio Recording, Audio Playing**, etc.

This kinda signal can be represented with infinity values of volts and because of that, we usually lose quality and information on its transference (since it can have lots of values and it is not possible to transfer all of them keeping its data without any lose).

### Digital Signal

The main difference between analog and digital signal is that the digital can be represented only by two values (per example 0 volts and 1 volt), what helps maintaining quality and information during its transference (since it has only two possible values, we are able to easily determine it when making transfers - if I receive 0.8 volts it probably means it was a 1 volt command, since it is closer to 1).

Being minded about it, the digital signal works basically by sending binary values to its receptors. Then, since only the format of the data changes from analog to digital, the analog signal can be converted into digital signal and vice-versa. That way, the digital signal can be used together with the analog on its implementations and can be used by itself on some others (that has only two representations by default).
