# Mindset: The new psychology of success

## Summary
This book explains the existence of two kinda mindsets: **Fixed** and **Growth**.

## Basic difference between mindsets
- Fixed
	- Which in contact with a challenge, gets stuck and just gives up on it.
	-	Afraid to make mistakes.
	- Feels good to take challenges that prove current knowledge.

- Growth
	-	Which in touch with a challenge, try everything possible to nail it.
	-	Not afraid to make mistakes and hungry for hard challenges.
	- "In the growth mindset, people does not only look for a challenge, but improve themselves with it. Bigger the challenge, bigger the improvement".

## The Growth Mindset

To maintain this kinda mindset, we must be open to the idea that we'll fail multiple times during our lifetime, but, even if the failure hurts, we must be able to overcome it since it give us the chance to improve ourselves - that's the most important idea.

Then, after failure experiences it is important to us to ask ourselves what we learned from it.

Besides, when in front of a challenge, we can not ask ourselves if we're able to accomplish that, but how we can accomplish.

## How to know which mindset I am enrolled at today?

One of the ways to know to which of these mindsets you belong today, just ask yourself: ```"When do you feel your intelligent? When you're perfect or when your learning?"```
