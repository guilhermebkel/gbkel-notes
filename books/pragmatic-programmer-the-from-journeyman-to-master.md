## Introduction

The main goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain a required system.

Software architecture is important to create good coding foundations easy to maintain without spending a lot of time or being stuck and not able to change anything if it was done in a poor way.

The measure of a good design quality is simply the measure of the effort required to meet the needs of the customer. If the effort is low and stays low throughout the lifetime of the system, the design is good. If that effort grows with each new release, the design is bad.
