# As armas da persuasão: Como influenciar e não se deixar influenciar

## Summary
This book shows the moments we are way too much influenced and tips to how to overcome it.

## Influential Tools
**1. Click, zum:** They are the ones fixed inside our habits. They're basically a start action that trigger a common response.

Ex:
- Someone is going to print something
- You ask: "Can I print my document because I need to print it?" **(Click)**
- You receive a response: "Yes" **(zum)**.

So, we can say it is a response (not minded) given by an input.

**2. Shortcuts:** When we give a easy/fast response to something based on a not minded thought. We usually do it because our modern life goes so fast that we can not take 100% minded decisions everytime (because we lack of time).

Ex:
- Your leader said you need to do 'A' and you feel like he meant 'B', but you don't try to say it to him because he's the leader.
- You buy something expensive because you assume that it is expensive because it is good.

## The Reciprocity

It is a tool that basically means if you give a person some favor that it didn't ask for, the person automatically owns you another favor (that you can customize by your necessity). It can work the most times because our civilization has grown with this habit and the idea that a favor need to be given back to who gave you first.

Ex:
- I give you some random favor that impacts you for good.
- I ask you for something that can be done following the level of the favor I gave you.

**1. Reciprocal concession:** When someone tries to give us something and we refuse it, if this person asks for something after, we're commonly driven to give something back since we refused the initial concession.

Ex:
- A little guy asks you to buy a cine ticket for $5 dollar bills and you refuse it.
- So he says "Well, if you're not going to buy this ticket, what about some chocolate? It will costs you $1".
- Then you buy the chocolate.
