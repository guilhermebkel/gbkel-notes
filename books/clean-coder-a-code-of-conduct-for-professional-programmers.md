# Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers

## Summary

This book gives some tips about how to be a better developer.

## Professionalism

It's a lot easier to be a nonprofessional. Nonprofessionals don't have to take responsibility for the job they do - they leave that to their employers. If a nonprofessional makes an error, the employer cleans up the mess. But when a professional makes a mistake, he clean up the mess.

Professionalism is all about taking responsibility.

### Taking Responsibility

#### Do No Harm to Function

We harm the function of our software when we create bugs. Therefore, in order to be professional, we must not create bugs.

The fact that the task to write perfect software is virtually impossible does not mean you aren't responsible for the imperfection.

It is the lot of a professional to be accountable for errors even though errors are virtually certain.

The first thing you must practice is apologizing. Apologies are necessary, but insufficient. You cannot simply keep making the same errors over and over. As you mature in your profession, your error rate should rapidly decrease towards the asymptote of zero. It won't ever get to zero, but it is your responsibility to get as close as possible to it.

**Things that can help avoiding bugs:** Automated tests, manual tests (test everything you can the maximum amount of times you are able to).

#### Do No Harm to Structure

The true professional knows that delivering function at the expense of structure is a fool's errand. It is the structure of your code that allows it to be flexible. If you compromise the structure, you compromise the future.

The fundamental assumption underlying all software projects is that software is easy to change. If you violate this assumption by creating inflexible structures, then you undercut the economic model that the entire industry is based on.

You must be able to make changes without exorbitant costs.

Since there are too many projects with poor structure, if you want your software to be flexible, you have to flex it.

The only way to prove that your software is easy to change is to make easy changes to it. And when you find that the changes aren't as easy as you thought, you refine the design so that the next change is easier.

### Work Ethic

Your career is your responsibility. It is not your employer's responsibility to make sure you are marketable. It is not your employer's responsibility to train you, or to send you to conferences, or to buy you books. These things are your responsibility.

It is also not your employer's responsibility to give you the time you need to learn.

Perhaps you don't want to make that kind of commitment of dedicating time to yourself. That's fine, but you should not then think of yourself as a professional. Professionals spend time for their profession.

#### Know Your Field

A wealth of ideas, disciplines, techniques, tools, and terminologies decorate the last fifty years of our field.

If you want to be professional, you should know a sizable chunk of it and constantly be increasing the size of that chunk.

Maybe some of the knowledge of that chunk can be irrelevant today, but be minded that who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

Below there are some stuffs every software professional should be conversant with:

- **Design patterns:** You ought to be able to describe all 24 patterns in the GOF book and have a working knowledge of many of the patterns in the POSA books.

- **Design principles:** You should know the SOLID principles and have a good understanding of the component principles.

- **Methods:** You should understand XP, Scrum, Lean, Kanban, Waterfall, Structured Analysis, and Structured Design.

- **Disciplines:** You should practice TDD, Object-Oriented design, Structured Programming, Continuous Programming, and Pair Programming.

- **Artifacts:** You should know how to use: UML, DFDs, Structure Charts, Petri Nets, State Transition Diagrams and Tables, flow charts, and decision tables.

#### Continuous Learning

Read books, articles, blogs, tweets. Go to conferences. Go to user groups. Participate in reading and study groups. Learn things that are outside your comfort zone.

#### Practice

Professionals practice. True professionals work hard to keep their skills sharp and ready. It is not enough to simply do your daily job and call that practice. Doing your daily job is performance, not practice. Practice is when you specifically exercise your skills outside of the performance of your job for the sole purpose of refining and enhancing those skills.

#### Collaboration

The second best way to learn is to collaborate with other people. Professional software developers make a special effort to program together, practice together, design and plan together.

#### Mentoring

The best way to learn is to teach. Nothing will drive facts and values into your head faster and harder than having to communicate them to people you are responsible for. So the benefit of teaching is strongly in favor of the teacher.

#### Know Your Domain

It is the responsibility of every software professional to understand the domain of the solutions they are programming. If you are writing an accounting system, you should know the accounting field.

#### Humility

Programming is an act of creation. When we write code we are creating something out of nothing. We are boldly imposing order upon chaos. We are confidently commanding, in precise detail, the behaviors of a machine that could otherwise do incalculable damage. And so, programming is an act of supreme arrogance.

Professionals know they are arrogant and are not falsely humble. A professional knows his job and takes pride in his work. A professional is confident is his abilities, and takes bold and calculated risks based on that confidence. A professional is not timid.

However, a professional also knows that there will be times he will fail, his risk calculations will be wrong, his abilities will fall short; he'll look in the mirror and see an arrogant fool smiling back at him.

So when a professional finds himself the butt of a joke, he'll be first to laugh. He will never ridicule others, but will accept ridicule when it is deserved and laugh it off when it's not. He will not demean another for making a mistake, because he knows he may be the next to fail.

A professional understands his supreme arrogance, and that the fates will eventually notice and level their aim. When that aim connects, the best you can do is take Howard's advice: Laugh.
