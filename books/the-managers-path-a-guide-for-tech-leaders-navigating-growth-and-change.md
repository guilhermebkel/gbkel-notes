# The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change

## Summary
This book gives some tips about how to become a Tech Leader.

## What to expect from a Manager
- **One-on-one meetings:** Good to improve relations, to give feedbacks about projects as well as solving doughts.
- **Feedback and Workplace Guidance:** Getting behavioral and technical feedbacks, helps improving people as soon as they've made something that is not so good or vice-versa (usually the bad ones must be given privately and the good ones publicly since it shows to other people what's usually a good act).
- **Training and Career Growth:** Receiving tips about courses, classes, books and every other thing that helps people improving themselves in order to grow in the career they want to.

## How to be Managed
- **Spend time thinking about what you want:** It's important to know what you're looking for your career since that's the only way the manager can helping you achieving it.
- **You are responsible for yourself:** Seek as many feedbacks as you can, if you're unhappy, say something, when you're stuck, ask for help, when you want a raise, ask for it, when you want a promotion, find out what you need to do in order to get it.
- **Give you're manager a break:** Always you're able to, bring solutions to your manager, not problems.
- **Choose your managers wisely:** Your manager can make a huge difference in your life, he can get you promoted, attention or feedback from important people and job opportunities after you stop working for them.

## Mentoring an Intern
- **Listen carefully:** That's the first and most basic skill of managing people. Pay attention to what others are saying, don't keep thinking about what you're going to say next neither about your own work. So, be prepared to say anything complex in different ways, just end the conversation if you really understood what the other said.
- **Clearly communicate:** If you're expecting something to happen by other people, talk about it.
- **Calibrate your response:** Lot of things can happen during the mentoring, so, in order to get a good project done by the intern, try to get in touch with him (once a week, etc) to give the right adjustments on what is going to be done.
- **Basic TO-DOs when you're going to mentoring an intern**: Prepare his arrival (prepare the place, tools, etc); Have a project for him to work on (have a clear project to get him to work on); Plan to have him present the work he did at the end of the program (optional).

## Tips to be a great Tech Lead
- **Understand the architecture:** If you were given to lead a project that you don't understand the architecture, give it a time to get it. Try to understand how to data flows on it, how it affects the final product and what is the core logic.
- **Be a Team Player:** If you're doing all the interesting stuff, try to find boring ones since it will help you understand the project problems and gaps. By doing that, you'll allow to other programmers to stretch themselves to big improvements (since they will be doing some harder stuffs).
- **Lead technical decisions:** You'll be involved in a lot of technical decisions, but it doesn't mean you have to decide everything. Try to understand what decisions need to be done by you and others that need to be done by the team and people with more expertise.
- **Communicate:** Give the team members a moment to talk and try to represent your team on the meetings. Now your productivity is less important than the productivity of the whole team.

## Tips for delegating effectively
- **Understands the team's goals:** When you feel that you need to make some micromanagement, try to understand how the team  is measuring their success. Based on that information, you'll see what course correction you need to do.
- **Gather information first from systems before going to people:** Seek code version, subscribe to alerts, look at the metrics, but don't abuse of it (like doing that every second) because you can make the team uncomfortable and less productive (no one likes to be stalked).
- **Establish standards for code and systems:** It is important to set some standards to be followed by the project making process, since it simplifies the communication inside the team and helps knowing what details are important to talk about.
- **Treat the open sharing information, good or bad, in a neutral to positive way:** If someone is struggling on some task and while not asking for help or even hiding important information intentionally, it means that you need to treat the share of information in another way. You have to make people feeling comfortable to share info about project outgoing, while giving them the trust to do what they feel that is needed to do.

## Tips for creating a culture of continuous feedback
- **Know your people:** It is important to know what is the people goals, weakness, strengths, the leven their currently operating at, where may them need to improve to next level. To help with it, you can use previous performance review or even sit down with them to ask about it.
- **Observe your people:** You can not give feedback if you're not paying attention to the people around you. You can task yourself to regularly look for people that need praises, weaknesses and it is important to do this fast (you can forget if you let the week pass or even the month).
- **Provide lightweight and regular feedback:** Starts with positive feedback (generally people respond better to this one) and later with negative/correctives ones, since people will get more comfortable to hear you.
- **Provide coaching:** Generally continuous feedback works better when you give some coaching with it. When things are going well, praise them, but at the same time, try to make suggestion of what could be done to be even better in the future.

## Writing and delivering performance review
- **Give yourself enough time and start early:** Even if you have lots of work to do, plan to spend a solid time working on reviews, you owe your team enough time to read collected feedback, digest it and summarize it.
- **Try to look for the whole year, not days or weeks:** Try to keep running a summary during your 1-1s, a full year feedback is important to see not only the accomplishments but also the growth and change you noticed on people.
- **Use concrete examples:** Try not to underlay on bias, but use concrete examples of what happened in order to support a point.
- **Spend plenty time on accomplishments and strengths**: Celebrate achievements, talk about what's going well and give plenty of praises for good work. Don't skip over the good stuff in order to obsess over the improvement areas.
- **Avoid big surprises**: Set expectations appropriately before reviews. If someone is under performing across the board, the review should not be his first time getting that feedback.

## Cultivating careers
If you're a manager, you're going to play a key role in getting people on your team promoted.

Generally, you'll look at them people on your team a couple times a year, so consider their job level and ask yourself if any of that people are closer to the next level.

You should also start identifying promotion-worthy projects and trying to give those projects to people who are close to promotion.

## Debugging dysfunctional teams
- **Not shipping:** One of the possible causes is that your team is using processes or tools that is hard to get work done quickly (per example releasing changes to productions once a week, which can hide pain points, bad testing, etc). You have to create a balance between pushing and holding back the back at all.
- **People drama:** You have to be brave and nip people drama in the bud quickly, since the negative person can make all the team unhappily and as long time as it takes, harder it is to finish it.
- **Unhappiness due to overwork:** In case the problem is due to the instability of the system, make clear measures of alerts, downtimes and incidents, since it is important to decrease it and plan system sustainability. In case it is due to pressing time-critical release, play a cheerleader role, make it fun, make it clear that they'll have a break time after the push, learn with this situation to avoid it in the future by taking the tasks that can be done without pushing all team too much.

## How to drive good decisions
- **Create a data-driven culture:** Try to get data about business, product, customer behavior, quality measures, and every other thing that can help you justify your decisions.
- **Flex your own product muscles:** You need to get in touch with what is important to your customer (the same evaluates for writing tools for other engineers, support team, etc. Treat them as customers.) So it is important to take time to develop customer empathy.
- **Look into the future:** You need to think two steps ahead, from a product and technology perspective, getting a sense of where the product roadmap is going helps you guide the technical roadmap, since many technical projects are supported on the strength of their ability to enable new feature more easily.
- **Review the outcome of your decisions and projects:** Try to get to know if your hypotheses were correct about doing that project, feature, etc.

## Good manager, Bad Manager
- **The alpha geek:** The person with high technical level, able to solve the most hard problems, able to inspire juniors but, accepts only his solution as the better and unique to be applied, most part of the time not letting other programmers being able to solve problems.
- **The process czar:** Tries to implement a process meant to be the unique able to solve all problems. Blame all the problems on the fact of people doesn't follow the process (only he does it most part of the time). "The process is that way, and we can not change it, since that's the unique way to help solving all project problems".
- **Micromanager, delegator:** Try to get in touch with every single decision made to the project (what makes the team to not feel trusted) and if it doesn't follow what he expected, he takes on the project for himself and try to do everything the "right" way in order to deliver the project to production on time.
- **Conflict avoider, conflict tamer:** Expose what problems are happening, don't hide them, but use your judgment as to what should be addressed. The key questions to ask are: Is this an ongoing problem? Or something you've personally noticed? Or a problem that many people on the team are struggling with? Is there a power dynamic or potential bias at play? The goal is to identify problems that are causing the team to work less effectively together.

## Challenging situations
- **Firing under performers:** One of the most important rules of management is the rule of no surprises, so, if the you know what the person is supposed to be giving you and it is not happening, you have to make it clear to him early. On top of that, don't put anyone on a improvement plan whom you wouldn't be happy to lose. In case you have an employee that asks yourself about what he needs to do to go to the next level and doesn't get there (by going again to comfort zone per example), try to explain and make it clear to him, give a chance to him to find a job in another part of the company or at another company (some times he needs it to shine).
- **Team cohesion destroyers:** If your team are friendly, but if there's a person who the team hate to work with, he's probably a cohesion destroyer. The first type of it is called **The Brilliant Jerk -** He produces individually outsized results but is also ego-driven that creates a mixture of fear and dislike in almost everyone around him (the best way to avoid him is to not hire him). The second one is called **The Noncommunicator -** That's the person who hides information from you, your teammates, his product manager, the person who instead of talking things out with teammates, reverts their commits, or takes their tickets and does the work for them (you need to nip his bad habit in the bud as fast as possible, simply by making it clear to him, showing why this is a bad habit). The third it called **The Employee Who Lacks Respect -** It is simply the toxic person who doesn't treat others with respect (make it clear to him that's not a good habit, and, if he keeps doing that after, start making his process to move out to another team or simply to leave the company).
